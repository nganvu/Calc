10/16       8:10pm      2:15        At office hour with Roland
                                    Read assignment
                                    Start programming
                                    Finish reading from input and extracting
                                      tokens
                                    Have trouble extracting the last token
                                      properly; realize that this was because
                                      the buffer returned by getline does not
                                      end with a null terminator

10/17       2:20pm      1:45        Finish implementing stack.c
                                    Still not understand why we have both top
                                      and count but it seems convenient to have
                                      top because we don't have to subtract 1
                                      from count every time
                                    Make the Makefile

10/22       8:30pm      1:30        Start adding tokens to stack
                                    Have trouble directing tokens to appropriate
                                      stacks; finally understand the order by
                                      running Calcx several times; also realize
                                      that stack should always be checked for
                                      length before the top of stack is examined

10/25       10:15pm     2:00        Implement the evaluateStack to calculate the
                                      value of RPN
                                    Work with memory leak, still not done

10/26       8:30am      1:00        My program is still leaking and I'm so sad
                                    At least I learned that when I have a
                                      a pointer to an array of character,
                                      and want to copy a string to that pointer,
                                      I should use strcpy instead of letting the
                                      pointer point to the starting address of
                                      the string, because then I will double
                                      free everything.
                                    Not sure why getline creates a memory leak.

                        8:30        TOTAL time spent

I discussed my solution with: Roland
